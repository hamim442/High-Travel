## Gerry's Journal

### Wednesday 8/7

Held our first standup. We worked on our database design, using our API endpoints as a reference and guide.

### Tuesday 8/6

We met with Bart to walk him through our API endpoints and wireframes. I took the lead to clean both files up to ensure they were ready for presentation.

### Monday 8/5

I took the lead by creating the initial set of three issues in our GitLab Issue Board. I then asked each team member to create one so everybody could practice.

### Thursday 8/1

We forked and cloned repo. We made required edits (not allowing to merge, etc.) and added Bart/Amy as owners. Created initial API endpoints in a Google Doc.
