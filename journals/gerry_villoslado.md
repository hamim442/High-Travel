## Gerry's Journal

### Thursday 8/29

Built a CreateNewCity component. Assisted my team on several questions.

### Wednesday 8/28

Completed some unit tests for city_router.py and created a basic README for the project. Helped my team with a couple of questions they had before joining a BR with Amy.

### Tuesday 8/27

I handed the CreateTravelPlan component over to Jason who did a merge request. Everything was working fine. I worked on Adding a Contributor.

### Monday 8/26

Traded components with Jason (Create Travel Plan). I worked on refactoring and ensuring the Create Travel Plan component worked and created a trip.

### Friday 8/23

Componentized the Random Destinations so it could be reused. Built a simple footer for other components to use. Explored the TripAdvisor API but it's not behaving as expected. Will move to OSS and Google Places APIs. I did a merge request to save the work above described. Alerted team of this.

### Thursday 8/22

Worked on the MainPage.jsx component. Managed to create a div in the bottom section that shows 5 random popular destinations drawing information from our database. These random destinations last for 24 hours, and then they refresh to show a new set.

### Wednesday 8/21

Worked on the CityPage.jsx and the Nav.jsx components. Created a div in the top section that shows the City, picture, and a description paragraph. The Nav search bar now shows results of cities. I did a merge-request and alerted the team for them to git pull/merge so they could have the latest version.

### Tuesday 8/20

Incorporated Nav (h/t Maximus) and MainPage into the app. Merge requested the initial draft, which looks clean and neat now.

### Monday 8/19

Resolved a conflict whereby someone had erroneously uploaded to main Nav and MainPage components. Worked on the new MainPage.

### Thursday 8/15

I was out for the day.

### Wednesday 8/14

I merge-requested for accommodations and user-trips APIs. I started working on the Nav and MainPage components, but we delegated Nav to Maximus and I continued working on the MainPage.

### Tuesday 8/13

I merge-requested for airlines, cities, and trips. We delegated the rest of the API endpoints to work in parallel. I spent the day pair-programming with Jason as we work towards completing the trips API endpoint to allow only authenticated users to see and create their own trips.

### Monday 8/12

I built our first API endpoint for airlines (models, queries, router, and exceptions). The team was following as I was tryping and I was looking at the Superhero app as reference.

### Friday 8/9

I was out sick. Missed Project Gamma.

### Thursday 8/8

We continued working on our database design as we got valuable feedback from Bart. The design is now complete.

### Wednesday 8/7

Held our first standup. We worked on our database design, using our API endpoints as a reference and guide.

### Tuesday 8/6

We met with Bart to walk him through our API endpoints and wireframes. I took the lead to clean both files up to ensure they were ready for presentation.

### Monday 8/5

I took the lead by creating the initial set of three issues in our GitLab Issue Board. I then asked each team member to create one so everybody could practice.

### Thursday 8/1

We forked and cloned repo. We made required edits (not allowing to merge, etc.) and added Bart/Amy as owners. Created initial API endpoints in a Google Doc.
