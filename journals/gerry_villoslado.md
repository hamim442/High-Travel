## Gerry's Journal

### Monday 8/19

Resolved a conflict whereby someone had erroneously uploaded to main Nav and MainPage components. Worked on the new MainPage.

### Thursday 8/15

I was out for the day.

### Wednesday 8/14

I merge-requested for accommodations and user-trips APIs. I started working on the Nav and MainPage components, but we delegated Nav to Maximus and I continued working on the MainPage.

### Tuesday 8/13

I merge-requested for airlines, cities, and trips. We delegated the rest of the API endpoints to work in parallel. I spent the day pair-programming with Jason as we work towards completing the trips API endpoint to allow only authenticated users to see and create their own trips.

### Monday 8/12

I built our first API endpoint for airlines (models, queries, router, and exceptions). The team was following as I was tryping and I was looking at the Superhero app as reference.

### Friday 8/9

I was out sick. Missed Project Gamma.

### Thursday 8/8

We continued working on our database design as we got valuable feedback from Bart. The design is now complete.

### Wednesday 8/7

Held our first standup. We worked on our database design, using our API endpoints as a reference and guide.

### Tuesday 8/6

We met with Bart to walk him through our API endpoints and wireframes. I took the lead to clean both files up to ensure they were ready for presentation.

### Monday 8/5

I took the lead by creating the initial set of three issues in our GitLab Issue Board. I then asked each team member to create one so everybody could practice.

### Thursday 8/1

We forked and cloned repo. We made required edits (not allowing to merge, etc.) and added Bart/Amy as owners. Created initial API endpoints in a Google Doc.
